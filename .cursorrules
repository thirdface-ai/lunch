name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

# Project-Specific Design Guidelines

## This Project's Tone: Industrial/Utilitarian with Braun-Inspired Warmth

## Core Design Philosophy: Dieter Rams Inspired

All designs in this project follow **Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of Good Design**:

1. **Good design is innovative** - Push boundaries while solving real problems
2. **Good design makes a product useful** - Form follows function
3. **Good design is aesthetic** - Visual quality is integral to usefulness
4. **Good design makes a product understandable** - Self-explanatory interfaces
5. **Good design is unobtrusive** - Products should be neutral and restrained
6. **Good design is honest** - No manipulation or false promises
7. **Good design is long-lasting** - Avoid trends, aim for timelessness
8. **Good design is thorough down to the last detail** - Nothing is arbitrary
9. **Good design is environmentally friendly** - Minimal, efficient code
10. **Good design is as little design as possible** - Less, but better

---

## Spacing & Padding System (CRITICAL)

**Use a consistent 4px/8px base unit system throughout:**

```css
/* Spacing Scale - Use ONLY these values */
--space-0: 0;
--space-1: 4px;    /* 0.25rem - Tight spacing */
--space-2: 8px;    /* 0.5rem  - Default small */
--space-3: 12px;   /* 0.75rem - Medium-small */
--space-4: 16px;   /* 1rem    - Default medium */
--space-5: 20px;   /* 1.25rem - Medium */
--space-6: 24px;   /* 1.5rem  - Large */
--space-8: 32px;   /* 2rem    - XL */
--space-10: 40px;  /* 2.5rem  - XXL */
--space-12: 48px;  /* 3rem    - Section spacing */
--space-16: 64px;  /* 4rem    - Major sections */
--space-20: 80px;  /* 5rem    - Page sections */
--space-24: 96px;  /* 6rem    - Hero spacing */
```

**Padding Consistency Rules:**
- Container padding: Always `--space-6` (24px) on mobile, `--space-8` (32px) on desktop
- Card/Panel padding: Always `--space-4` (16px) or `--space-6` (24px)
- Button padding: Horizontal `--space-4`, Vertical `--space-2` or `--space-3`
- Input padding: Horizontal `--space-3`, Vertical `--space-2`
- List item spacing: `--space-2` or `--space-3` between items
- Section margins: `--space-12` or `--space-16` between major sections

## This Project's Design Language

### Color Palette (Braun-Inspired)

```css
/* Light Theme */
--braun-bg: #F5F5F0;           /* Warm off-white */
--braun-dark: #1A1A1A;         /* Near-black */
--braun-border: #C4C4B8;       /* Warm gray */
--braun-text-muted: #707070;   /* Muted text */
--braun-orange: #FF4400;       /* Accent - Warm orange */

/* Dark Theme */
--dark-bg: #0F0F0F;            /* Deep black */
--dark-text: #E8E8E8;          /* Off-white text */
--dark-border: #2A2A2A;        /* Subtle border */
--dark-text-muted: #6B6B6B;    /* Muted text */
```

### Typography

- **Display/Headers**: `'Inter', sans-serif` - Bold, tight tracking
- **Monospace/Data**: `'Roboto Mono', monospace` - Technical readability
- **Body**: System fonts for performance

### Component Patterns

- **Buttons**: Minimal, uppercase labels, subtle hover states
- **Cards**: Sharp corners or very subtle radius (2-4px), clear hierarchy
- **Inputs**: Understated borders, focus states with accent color
- **Icons**: Functional, not decorative - use sparingly

---

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- ❌ Overused font families (Arial, system fonts only)
- ❌ Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- ❌ Predictable layouts and component patterns
- ❌ Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- ❌ Inconsistent padding/spacing values
- ❌ Decorative elements without purpose
- ❌ Skeuomorphic details that don't add function

---

## Implementation Checklist

When building any UI component:

1. [ ] Uses spacing scale values (no arbitrary pixel values)
2. [ ] Follows color palette from CSS variables
3. [ ] Maintains consistent padding across similar elements
4. [ ] Includes appropriate hover/focus states
5. [ ] Works in both light and dark themes
6. [ ] Accessible (proper contrast, focus indicators)
7. [ ] Responsive (mobile-first approach)
8. [ ] Production-grade and functional

---

## Code Quality Standards

```typescript
// Component structure should be clean and organized
// Props should be typed
// Use semantic HTML elements
// Separate concerns (logic vs presentation)
// Use CSS variables for theming
// Keep animations subtle and purposeful
```

---

**Remember**: Good design is as little design as possible. Every element should earn its place. If it doesn't serve the user, remove it.
